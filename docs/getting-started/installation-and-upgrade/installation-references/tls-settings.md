Changing the default TLS settings depends on the chosen installation method.

## Running Rancher in a highly available Kubernetes cluster

When you install Rancher inside of a Kubernetes cluster, TLS is offloaded at the cluster's ingress controller. The possible TLS settings depend on the used ingress controller:

* nginx-ingress-controller (default for RKE1 and RKE2): [Default TLS Version and Ciphers](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/tls/#default-tls-version-and-ciphers).
* traefik (default for K3s): [TLS Options](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/tls/#tls-options).

## Running Rancher in a single Docker container

The default TLS configuration only accepts TLS 1.2 and secure TLS cipher suites. You can change this by setting the following environment variables:

| Parameter | Description | Default | Available options |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| `CATTLE_TLS_MIN_VERSION` | Minimum TLS version | `1.2` | `1.0`, `1.1`, `1.2`, `1.3` |
| `CATTLE_TLS_CIPHERS` | Allowed TLS cipher suites | `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`,<br/>`TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`,<br/>`TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305`,<br/>`TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`,<br/>`TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`,<br/>`TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305` | See [Golang tls constants](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#pkg-constants) |

## Agent TLS Enforcement

The `agent-tls-mode` setting controls how Rancher's agents (including cluster-agent, fleet-agent, and system-agent) evaluate Rancher's certificate.

When the value is `strict`, Rancher's agents will only trust certificates generated by the Certificate Authority contained in the `cacerts` setting. 
When the value is `system-store`, Rancher's agents will trust any certificate generated by a public Certificate Authority contained in the operating system's trust store (including those signed by authorities such as Let's Encrypt). This can be a security risk, since any certificate generated by these authorities will be viewed as valid.

While the `strict` option enables a higher level of security, it requires Rancher to have access to the CA which generated the certificate visible to the agents. In the case of certain certificate configurations (notably, external certificates), this is not automatic, and extra configuration will be needed. See the [installation guide](../install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster.md#3-choose-your-ssl-configuration) for more information on which scenarios require extra configuration.

This setting defaults to `strict` on new installs of Rancher (starting with v2.9.0), but is set as `system-store` for users installing/upgrading from a prior version.

### Preparing for the Setting Change

Each cluster contains a condition in the status field called `AgentTlsStrictCheck`. If its value is set to "True", this indicates the agents for the cluster are ready to operate using the `strict` mode. You can manually inspect each cluster to see if they are ready using the Rancher UI, or a kubectl command like the following:

```bash
## the below command skips ouputs $CLUSTER_NAME,$STATUS for all non-local clusters
kubectl get cluster.management.cattle.io -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@.metadata.name!="local")]}{.metadata.name},{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="AgentTlsStrictCheck")].status}{"\n"}{end}'
```

### Changing the Setting

You can change the setting using the Rancher UI or the `agentTLSMode` [helm chart option](./helm-chart-options.md).

:::note

If you specify the value through the Helm chart, you may only modify the value with helm.

:::

:::warning

Depending on your cert setup, additional action (such as uploading the Certificate Authority which signed your certs) may be required. Review the [installation guide](../install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster.md#3-choose-your-ssl-configuration) before changing the setting to see if any additional requirements apply to your setup.

:::

To change the setting's value through the UI, navigate to the "Global Settings" page, and find the `agent-tls-mode` setting near the bottom of the page. When you change the setting through the UI, Rancher will first check that all downstream clusters have the condition `AgentTlsStrictCheck` set to `True` before allowing the request, in order to prevent outages from a certificate mismatch.


#### Overriding the Setting Validation Checks

In some cases, you may want to override the check ensuring all agents can accept the new TLS configuration. To do so, you must update the setting using following these steps:

:::warning

Rancher checks the status of all clusters to prevent downstream cluster outages. Overriding this check is not recommended, and should be done with great caution.

:::

1. As an admin, generate a kubeconfig for the local cluster. In the below examples, this was saved to the `local_kubeconfig.yaml` file.
2. Using the following command, retrieve the current setting and save it to the `setting.yaml` file:
```bash
kubectl get setting agent-tls-mode -o yaml --kubeconfig=local_kubeconfig.yaml >> setting.yaml
```
3. Update the `setting.yaml` file, replacing `value` with `strict`. Adding the `cattle.io/force: true` annotation will override the cluster condition check, and should only be done with great care:
```yaml
apiVersion: management.cattle.io/v3
customized: false
default: strict
kind: Setting
metadata:
  name: agent-tls-mode
  annotations:
    cattle.io/force: "true"
source: ""
value: strict
```
4. Apply the new version of the setting:
```bash
kubectl apply -f setting.yaml --kubeconfig=local_kubeconfig.yaml
```
